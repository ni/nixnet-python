Contributing to nixnet
=======================

Contributions to **nixnet** are welcome from all!

**nixnet** is managed via `git <https://git-scm.com>`_, with the canonical
upstream repository hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/ni/nixnet-python>`_.

**nixnet** follows a pull-request model for development.  If you wish to
contribute, you will need to create a GitHub account, fork this project,
push a branch with your changes to your project, and then submit a pull
request.

See `GitHub's official documentation <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/>`_
for more details.

Getting Started
---------------

To contribute to this project, it is recommended that you follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Run the unit tests on your system (see Testing section). At this point,
   if any tests fail, do not begin development. Try to investigate these
   failures. If you're unable to do so, report an issue through our
   `GitHub issues page <http://github.com/ni/nixnet-python/issues>`_.
3. Write new tests that demonstrate your bug or feature. Ensure that these
   new tests fail.
4. Make your change.
5. Run all the unit tests again (which include the tests you just added),
   and confirm that they all pass.
6. Send a GitHub Pull Request to the ni/nixnet-python main branch. GitHub
   Pull Requests are the expected method of code collaboration on this project.

Testing
-------

In order to be able to run the **nixnet** unit tests, your setup should meet
the following minimum requirements:

  - Setup has a machine with NI-XNET or the NI-XNET Runtime installed.
  - Machine has a supported version of CPython or PyPy installed.
  - **TODO** Document required hardware and system setup.

**nixnet** relies on `tox <http://tox.readthedocs.io>`_ and `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.html>`_ for testing

  $ pip install tox

To run the tests::

  $ # Unit tests:
  $ tox
  $ # Integration tests:
  $ tox -c tox-integration.ini -- --can-in-interface CAN1 --can-out-interface CAN2 --lin-in-interface LIN1 --lin-out-interface LIN2
  $ # Integration tests (no LIN board):
  $ tox -c tox-integration.ini -- --can-in-interface CAN1 --can-out-interface CAN2

Examples for debugging failures::

  $ # Only run Python 3.9 unit tests
  $ tox -e py39-test
  $ # Further filter those tests to all starting with test_frames
  $ tox -e py39-test -- -k test_frames
  $ # Drop into PDB on first failure and quit when done
  $ tox -e py39-test -- -x --pdb
