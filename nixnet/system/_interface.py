        '''Blinks LEDs for the XNET interface to identify its physical port in the system.

        Each XNET device contains one or two physical ports. Each port is
        labeled on the hardware as Port 1 or Port 2. The XNET device also
        provides two LEDs per port. For a two-port board, LEDs 1 and 2 are
        assigned to Port 1, and LEDs 3 and 4 are assigned to physical Port 2.

        When your application uses multiple XNET devices, this function helps
        to identify each interface to associate its software behavior to its
        hardware connection (port). Prior to running your XNET sessions, you
        can call this function to blink the interface LEDs.

        For example, if you have a system with three PCI CAN cards, each with
        two ports, you can use this function to blink the LEDs for interface
        CAN4, to identify it among the six CAN ports.

        The LEDs of each port support two states:
            Identification:
                Blink LEDs to identify the physical port assigned to the interface.
            In Use:
                LED behavior that XNET sessions control.

        **Identification LED State**

        You can use the ``blink`` function only in the Identification state. If
        you call this function while one or more XNET sessions for the
        interface are open (created), it returns an error, because the port's
        LEDs are in the In Use state.

        **In Use LED State**

        When you create an XNET session for the interface, the LEDs for that
        physical port transition to the In Use state. If you called the ``blink``
        function previously to enable blinking for identification, that LED
        behavior no longer applies. The In Use LED state remains until all XNET
        sessions are cleared. This typically occurs when the application
        terminates. The patterns that appear on the LEDs while In Use are
        documented in LEDs.

        Args:
            moodifier (:any:`nixnet._enums.BlinkMode`): Controls LED blinking

                Both LEDs blink green (not red). The blinking rate is approximately
                three times per second.
