class CanCommState(enum.Enum):
    """CAN Comm State.

    Values:
        ERROR_ACTIVE:
            This state reflects normal communication, with few errors detected.
            The CAN interface remains in this state as long as receive error
            counter and transmit error counter are both below 128.
        ERROR_PASSIVE:
            If either the receive error counter or transmit error counter
            increment above 127, the CAN interface transitions into this state.
            Although communication proceeds, the CAN device generally is assumed
            to have problems with receiving frames.

            When a CAN interface is in error passive state, acknowledgement
            errors do not increment the transmit error counter. Therefore, if
            the CAN interface transmits a frame with no other device (ECU)
            connected, it eventually enters error passive state due to
            retransmissions, but does not enter bus off state.
        BUS_OFF:
            If the transmit error counter increments above 255, the CAN
            interface transitions into this state. Communication immediately
            stops under the assumption that the CAN interface must be isolated
            from other devices.

            When a CAN interface transitions to the bus off state, communication
            stops for the interface. All NI-XNET sessions for the interface no
            longer receive or transmit frame values. To restart the CAN
            interface and all its sessions, call
            :any:`nixnet._session.base.SessionBase.start`.
        INIT:
            This is the CAN interface initial state on power-up. The interface
            is essentially off, in that it is not attempting to communicate with
            other nodes (ECUs).

            When the start trigger occurs for the CAN interface, it transitions
            from the Init state to the Error Active state. When the interface
            stops due to a call to :any:`nixnet._session.base.SessionBase.stop`.,
            the CAN interface transitions from either Error Active or Error Passive
            to the Init state. When the interface stops due to the Bus Off state,
            it remains in that state until you restart.
