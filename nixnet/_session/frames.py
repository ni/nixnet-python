                seconds. During the read, two frames are received, the first 24
                bytes in size, and the second 56 bytes in size, for a total of
                80 bytes. The read returns after the two frames are received,

                46 bytes of the second frame (up to the limit of 70), that frame
                would be incomplete and therefore difficult to interpret. To
