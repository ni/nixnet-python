        For output sessions, queues store data passed to the appropriate
        write function and not yet transmitted onto the network. For input
        sessions, queues store data received from the network and not yet
        obtained using the appropriate read function.

        For most applications, the default queue sizes are sufficient. You can
        write to this property to override the default. When you write (set)
        this property, you must do so prior to the first session start. You
        cannot set this property again after calling
        :any:`nixnet._session.base.SessionBase.stop`.

        For signal I/O sessions, this property is the number of signal values
        stored. This is analogous to the number of values you use with the
        appropriate read or write function.

        For frame I/O sessions, this property is the number of bytes of frame
        data stored.

        For standard CAN or LIN frame I/O sessions, each frame uses exactly 24
        bytes. You can use this number to convert the Queue Size (in bytes)
        to/from the number of frame values.

        For CAN FD and FlexRay frame I/O sessions, each frame value size can
        vary depending on the payload length. For more information, refer to
        Raw Frame Format.

        For Signal I/O XY sessions, you can use signals from more than one frame.
        Within the implementation, each frame uses a dedicated queue. According
        to the formulas below, the default queue sizes can be different for each
        frame. If you read the default Queue Size property for a Signal Input XY
        session, the largest queue size is returned, so that a call to the
        appropriate read function of that size can empty all queues. If you
        read the default Queue Size property for a Signal Output XY session, the
        smallest queue size is returned, so that a call to the appropriate write
        function of that size can succeed when all queues are empty. If you
        write the Queue Size property for a Signal I/O XY session, that size is
        used for all frames, so you must ensure that it is sufficient for the
        frame with the fastest transmit time.

        For Signal I/O Waveform sessions, you can use signals from more than one
        frame. Within the implementation, each frame uses a dedicated queue. The
        Queue Size property does not represent the memory in these queues, but
        rather the amount of time stored. The default queue allocations store
        Application Time worth of resampled signal values. If you read the
        default Queue Size property for a Signal I/O Waveform session, it
        returns Application Time multiplied by the time Resample Rate. If you
        write the Queue Size property for a Signal I/O Waveform session, that
        value is translated from a number of samples to a time, and that time is
        used to allocate memory for each queue.

        For Single-Point sessions (signal or frame), this property is ignored.
        Single-Point sessions always use a value of 1 as the effective queue size.
